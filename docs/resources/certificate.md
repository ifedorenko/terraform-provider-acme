# acme_certificate

The `acme_certificate` resource can be used to create and manage an ACME TLS
certificate.

-> **NOTE:** As the usage model of Terraform generally sees it as being run on
a different server than a certificate would normally be placed on, the
`acme_certificate` resource only supports DNS challenges.

## Example

The below example creates both an account and certificate within the same
configuration. The account is created using the
[`acme_registration`][resource-registration] resource.

-> When creating accounts and certificates within the same configuration, ensure
that you reference the
[`account_key_pem`][resource-registration-account-key-pem] argument in the
`acme_registration` resource as the corresponding
[`account_key_pem`](#account_key_pem) argument in the `acme_certificate`
resource. This will ensure that the account gets created before the certificate
and avoid errors.

[resource-registration]: ./registration.md
[resource-registration-account-key-pem]: ./registration.md#account_key_pem

```hcl
provider "acme" {
  server_url = "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
}

resource "tls_private_key" "private_key" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
}

resource "acme_registration" "reg" {
  account_key_pem = "${tls_private_key.private_key.private_key_pem}"
  email_address   = "nobody@example.com"
}

resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  account_key_pem           = "${acme_registration.reg.account_key_pem}"
  common_name               = "www.example.com"
  subject_alternative_names = ["www2.example.com"]

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "route53"
  }
}
```

### Using an external CSR

The `acme_certificate` resource can also take an external CSR. In this example,
we create one using [`tls_cert_request`][tls-cert-request] first, before
supplying it to the [`certificate_request_pem`](#certificate_request_pem)
argument.

[tls-cert-request]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls/latest/docs/resources/cert_request

-> **NOTE:** Some current ACME CA implementations (including Let's Encrypt)
strip most of the organization information out of a certificate request
subject.  You may wish to confirm with the CA what behavior to expect when
using the `certificate_request_pem` argument with this resource.

~> **NOTE:** It is not a good practice to use the same private key for both
your account and your certificate. Make sure you use different keys.

```hcl
provider "acme" {
  server_url = "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
}

resource "tls_private_key" "reg_private_key" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
}

resource "acme_registration" "reg" {
  account_key_pem = "${tls_private_key.reg_private_key.private_key_pem}"
  email_address   = "nobody@example.com"
}

resource "tls_private_key" "cert_private_key" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
}

resource "tls_cert_request" "req" {
  key_algorithm   = "RSA"
  private_key_pem = "${tls_private_key.cert_private_key.private_key_pem}"
  dns_names       = ["www.example.com", "www2.example.com"]

  subject {
    common_name = "www.example.com"
  }
}

resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  account_key_pem         = "${acme_registration.reg.account_key_pem}"
  certificate_request_pem = "${tls_cert_request.req.cert_request_pem}"

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "route53"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The resource takes the following arguments:

~> All arguments in `acme_certificate`, other than `min_days_remaining`, force a
new resource when changed.

* `account_key_pem` (Required) - The private key of the account that is
  requesting the certificate.
* `common_name` - The certificate's common name, the primary domain that the
  certificate will be recognized for. Required when not specifying a CSR.
* `subject_alternative_names` - The certificate's subject alternative names,
  domains that this certificate will also be recognized for. Only valid when not
  specifying a CSR.
* `key_type` - The key type for the certificate's private key. Can be one of:
  `P256` and `P384` (for ECDSA keys of respective length) or `2048`, `4096`, and
  `8192` (for RSA keys of respective length). Required when not specifying a
  CSR. The default is `2048` (RSA key of 2048 bits).
* `certificate_request_pem` - A pre-created certificate request, such as one
  from [`tls_cert_request`][tls-cert-request], or one from an external source,
  in PEM format.  Either this, or the in-resource request options (`common_name`,
  `key_type`, and optionally `subject_alternative_names`) need to be specified.
* `dns_challenge` (Required) - The [DNS challenges](#using-dns-challenges) to
  use in fulfilling the request.
* `disable_propagation` (Optional) - Disable the check for propagation 
  of the TXT challenge record before proceeding with validation.
  Defaults to `false`. Useful in conjunction with `exec` DNS provider,
  where the external executable blocks until DNS challenge record was fully
  propagated. Incompatible with other propagation check configuration parameters
  (`disable_complete_propagation`, `pre_check_delay`, etc).
* `recursive_nameservers` (Optional) - The [recursive
  nameservers](#manually-specifying-recursive-nameservers-for-propagation-checks)
  that will be used to check for propagation of the challenge record. Defaults
  to your system-configured DNS resolvers.
* `disable_complete_propagation` (Optional) - Disable the requiement for full
  propagation of the TXT challenge record before proceeding with validation.
  Defaults to `false`. Only recommended for testing.
* `pre_check_delay` (Optional) - Insert a delay after _every_ DNS challenge
  record to allow for extra time for DNS propagation before the certificate is
  requested. Use this option if you observe issues with requesting certificates
  even when DNS challenge records get added successfully. Units are in seconds.
  Defaults to 0 (no delay).

-> Be careful with `pre_check_delay` since the delay is executed _per-domain_.
Take your expected delay and divide it by the number of domains you have
configured (`common_name` + `subject_alternative_names`).

* `must_staple` (Optional) Enables the [OCSP Stapling Required][ocsp-stapling]
  TLS Security Policy extension. Certificates with this extension must include a
  valid OCSP Staple in the TLS handshake for the connection to succeed.
  Defaults to `false`. Note that this option has no effect when using an
  external CSR - it must be enabled in the CSR itself.

[ocsp-stapling]: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/#implement-ocsp-stapling

-> OCSP stapling requires specific webserver configuration to support the
downloading of the staple from the CA's OCSP endpoints, and should be configured
to tolerate prolonged outages of the OCSP service. Consider this when using
`must_staple`, and only enable it if you are sure your webserver or service
provider can be configured correctly.

* `min_days_remaining` (Optional) - The minimum amount of days remaining on the
  expiration of a certificate before a renewal is attempted. The default is
  `30`. A value of less than `0` means that the certificate will never be
  renewed.
* `certificate_p12_password` - (Optional) Password to be used when generating
  the PFX file stored in [`certificate_p12`](#certificate_p12). Defaults to an
  empty string.

### Using DNS challenges

As the usage model of Terraform generally sees it as being run on a different
server than a certificate would normally be placed on, the `acme_certificate`
resource only supports DNS challenges. This method authenticates certificate
domains by requiring the requester to place a TXT record on the FQDNs in the
certificate.

The ACME provider responds to DNS challenges automatically by utilizing one of
the supported DNS challenge providers. Most providers take credentials as
environment variables, but if you would rather use configuration for this
purpose, you can by specifying `config` blocks within a
[`dns_challenge`](#dns_challenge) block, along with the `provider` parameter.

See the DNS providers subcategory for a full list of DNS providers.

```hcl
resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  #...

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "route53"

    config = {
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = "${var.aws_access_key}"
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "${var.aws_secret_key}"
      AWS_SESSION_TOKEN     = "${var.aws_security_token}"
      AWS_DEFAULT_REGION    = "us-east-1"  # OPTIONAL
    }
  }

  #...
}
```

#### Using Variable Files for Provider Arguments

Most provider arguments can be suffixed with `_FILE` to specify that you wish to
store that value in a local file. This can be useful if local storage for these
values is desired over configuration as variables or within the environment.

```hcl
resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  #...

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "route53"

    config = {
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_FILE     = "/data/secrets/aws_access_key_id"
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FILE = "/data/secrets/aws_secret_access_key"
      AWS_DEFAULT_REGION         = "us-east-1"
    }
  }

  #...
}
```

#### Manually specifying recursive nameservers for propagation checks

The ACME provider will normally use your system-configured DNS resolvers to
check for propagation of the TXT records before proceeding with the certificate
request. In split horizon scenarios, this check may never succeed, as the
machine running Terraform may not have visibility into these public DNS
records.

To override this default behavior, supply the `recursive_nameservers` to use as
a list in `host:port`:

```hcl
resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  #...

  recursive_nameservers = ["8.8.8.8:53"]

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "route53"
  }

  #...
}
```

#### Using multiple primary DNS providers

The ACME provider will allow you to configure multiple DNS challenges in the
event that you have more than one primary DNS provider.

```hcl
resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  #...

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "azure"
  }

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "gcloud"
  }

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "route53"
  }

  #...
}
```

Some considerations need to be kept in mind when using multiple providers:

* You cannot use more than one provider of the same type at once.
* Your NS records must be correctly configured so that each DNS challenge
  provider can correctly discover the appropriate zone to update.
* DNS propagation checks are conducted once per configured common name and
  subject alternative name, using the highest configured or default propagation
  timeout (`*_PROPAGATION_TIMEOUT`) and polling interval (`*_POLLING_INTERVAL`)
  settings.

#### Relation to Terraform provider configuration

The DNS provider configuration specified in the `acme_certificate` resource is
separate from any that you supply in a corresponding provider whose
functionality overlaps with the certificate's DNS providers.  This ensures that
there are no hard dependencies between any of these providers and the ACME
provider, but it is important to note so that configuration is supplied
correctly.

As an example, if you specify manual configuration for the [AWS
provider][tf-provider-aws] via the [`provider`][tf-providers] block instead of
the environment, you will still need to supply the configuration explicitly as
per above.

[tf-provider-aws]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest
[tf-providers]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html

Some of these providers have environment variable settings that overlap with
the ones found here, generally depending on whether or not these variables are
supported by the corresponding provider's SDK.

Check the documentation of a specific DNS provider for more details on exactly
what variables are supported.

## Certificate renewal

The `acme_certificate` resource handles automatic certificate renewal so long
as a plan or apply is done within the number of days specified in the
[`min_days_remaining`](#min_days_remaining) resource parameter. During refresh,
if Terraform detects that the certificate is within the expiry range specified
in `min_days_remaining`, or is already expired, Terraform will mark the
certificate to be renewed on the next apply.

Note that a value less than `0` supplied to `min_days_remaining` will cause
renewal checks to be bypassed, and the certificate will never renew.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - A UUID identifying the resource in Terraform state.

-> As of provider version 2.0, this is no longer the same as `certificate_url`.
Refer to that field for the current URL of the certificate.

* `certificate_url` - The full URL of the certificate within the ACME CA.
* `certificate_domain` - The common name of the certificate.
* `private_key_pem` - The certificate's private key, in PEM format, if the
  certificate was generated from scratch and not with
  [`certificate_request_pem`](#certificate_request_pem).  If
  `certificate_request_pem` was used, this will be blank.
* `certificate_pem` - The certificate in PEM format. This does not include the
  `issuer_pem`. This certificate can be concatenated with `issuer_pem` to form
  a full chain, e.g. `"${acme_certificate.certificate.certificate_pem}${acme_certificate.certificate.issuer_pem}"`
* `issuer_pem` - The intermediate certificate of the issuer.
* `certificate_p12` - The certificate, intermediate, and the private key
  archived as a PFX file (PKCS12 format, generally used by Microsoft products).
  The data is base64 encoded (including padding), and its password is
  configurable via the [`certificate_p12_password`](#certificate_p12_password)
  argument. This field is empty if creating a certificate from a CSR.
